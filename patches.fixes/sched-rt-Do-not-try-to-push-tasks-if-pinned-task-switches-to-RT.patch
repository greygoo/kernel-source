Subject: [PATCH] sched/rt: Do not try to push tasks if pinned task switches to RT
Git-commit: 10447917551e0fffb8d1892d46e633c3e0a9c1ec
Patch-mainline: v3.15-rc8
References: [js] I have no idea

Just switched pinned task is not able to be pushed. If the rq had had
several RT tasks before they have already been considered as candidates
to be pushed (or pulled).
